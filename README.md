Collection of SVG graphics for web development is here to help you get clean from your animated GIF addiction.

##Summary
Modern web browsers allow you to embed SVG directly in DOM. This is a very powerful tool that can help you create better user experience with:

- Vector graphics
- Full colors
- Smooth animation
- Advanced effects
- Programmable visuals

Animated GIFs can't give you any of this. In the past you had to use online image generators to get loader images for your AJAX loading. Now you can just change couple lines of XML code. You can even change the look of these elements by writing custom CSS rules or change it on the fly by manipulating DOM with Javascript like you're used to.

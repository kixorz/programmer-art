Collection of SVG graphics for web development to help you get clean from your animated GIF addiction.

##Summary
Modern web development allows you to embed SVG directly in DOM. This is a very powerful tool that can help you create better user experience with:

- Full colors
- Smooth animation
- Advanced effects
- Programmable visuals

Animated GIFs can't give you any of this. In the past you had to use online image generators to get what you want. Now you can just change couple lines of XML code. You can even change the look of these elements by writing custom CSS rules or change it on the fly by manipulating DOM with Javascript like you're used to.
